# odin-recipes

This project is to create a basic recipe website.
It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

Some of the skills I will have to demonstrate in building this website are:
- Set up a basic directory structure that hosts multiple html files for the different recipe pages
- Create a homepage for the website that lists all of the recipes using <ul>, <ol> and heading tags
- Create links to those recipes that bring me to different web pages using <a>
- Create lists of ingredients in the recipe pages using <ul> and <ol>
- Create paragraphs of instructions in the recipes using <p>
- Format those paragraphs with bold and italic text using <strong> and <em>
