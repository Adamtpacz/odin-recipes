        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A simple and easy mushroom risotto made with homemade mushroom stock
        that packs a ton of umami for not much effort. Recipe courtesy of Adam
        Ragusea on YouTube.</p>
        <p>Authentic Italian-style risotto cooked the slow and painful way, 
        but-oh so worth it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very 
        well. Check the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente 
        (or resist slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).</p>
