        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A simple and easy mushroom risotto made with homemade mushroom stock
        that packs a ton of umami for not much effort. Recipe courtesy of Adam
        Ragusea on YouTube.</p>
        <p>Authentic Italian-style risotto cooked the slow and painful way, 
        but-oh so worth it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very 
        well. Check the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente 
        (or resist slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>16 oz (1/2 kilo) mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1-2 carrots</li>
            <li>1-2 celery stalks</li>
            <li>1-2 shallots</li>
            <li>4-6 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 cup (200g) risotto rice</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cognac (or white wine, or water/stock + a little balsamic 
            vinegar)</li>
            <li>Parmesan or pecorino cheese (or vegan sour cream instead of 
            cheese and butter)</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Chives</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pull the stems out of all the mushrooms and wash the stems, if 
            necessary. In a large sauce pan, fry the stems in olive oil until 
            thoroughly browned. Roughly chop the onion, carrots and celery, and 
            put them in with the stems. Cook the vegetables until they're 
            starting to brown, stirring constantly. Cover everything in water 
            and simmer for about two hours. Strain, discard the solids, and 
            season the stock with salt (and/or MSG) to taste.</li>
            <li>Slice the mushroom caps into big chunks. Finely chop the shallots 
            and garlic. In a wide pan, start heating a big knob of butter and a 
            glug of olive oil. Put in the mushrooms and saut√© until most of their 
            water has come out and evaporated and the mushrooms are thoroughly 
            browned.</li>
            <li>Push the mushrooms to the rim of the pan and dump the shallots 
            in the center. Stir and fry the shallots for a moment, then dump in 
            the garlic and stir to combine everything in the pan. Make another 
            well in the center of the pan then dump in the rice. Stir the rice 
            and let it brown for a moment, then stir to combine everything in 
            the pan.</li>
            <li>If using cognac or wine, deglaze with a big splash of it now. 
            If not, deglaze with water/stock and put in a little glug of balsamic 
            vinegar. Then add enough stock to more than cover the rice, and let 
            is simmer aggressively until absorbed, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Then start adding additional stock in small doses and stirring 
            constantly until the rice is almost cooked (which you should 
            test by tasting). If you run out of your mushroom stock, just use 
            water. When the rice is almost cooked, turn the heat off and stir 
            in a big knob of butter and a big pile of grated cheese (or vegan 
            sour cream instead of butter and cheese), and black pepper and 
            additional salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve and top with fresh chopped chives.</li>
        </ol>
