        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish is a deli egg-bacon-and-cheese-on-a-roll that 
        has been pasta-fied, fancified, fetishized and turned into 
        an Italian tradition that, like many inviolate Italian 
        traditions, is actually far less old than the Mayflower.</p>
        <p>Because America may have contributed to its creation, 
        carbonara is Exhibit A in the back-and-forth between Italy 
        and the United States when it comes to food. Remember: 
        the main goal is creaminess.</p>
