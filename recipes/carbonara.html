        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish is a deli egg-bacon-and-cheese-on-a-roll that 
        has been pasta-fied, fancified, fetishized and turned into 
        an Italian tradition that, like many inviolate Italian 
        traditions, is actually far less old than the 
        Mayflower.</p>
        <p>Because America may have contributed to its creation, 
        carbonara is Exhibit A in the back-and-forth between Italy 
        and the United States when it comes to food. Remember: 
        the main goal is creaminess.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pound (450g) dried spaghetti</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced guanciale, pancetta, or bacon (85g)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil, 
            divided</li>
            <li>2 whole large eggs plus 6 yolks</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano (about 1 ounce; 25g), 
            plus more for serving</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (about 1 ounce, 
            25g), plus more for serving</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for
            serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and 
            cook, stirring, until al dente.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine guanciale (or pancetta or bacon) 
            with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a large skillet 
            and cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat, until 
            fat has rendered and guanciale is crisp, about 7 
            minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large, metal heatproof mixing bowl, whisk 
            together whole eggs and yolks, Pecorino Romano, 
            Parmigiano-Reggiano, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Using tongs and/or a strainer, transfer pasta to 
            skillet with crisped guanciale and its fat; be sure not 
            to drain boiling pasta water. Add remaining 1 tablespoon 
            (15ml) olive oil to pasta and stir to combine; let cool 
            slightly. Scrape pasta, pork, and all the fat into the 
            egg mixture. Measure 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta-cooking water 
            and add to pasta and egg mixture. Stir well to 
            combine.</li>
            <li>Set mixing bowl over pot of boiling pasta water 
            (make sure bottom of bowl does not touch the water) 
            and cook, stirring quickly with tongs, until sauce 
            thickens to a creamy, silky consistency and leaves 
            trails as you stir. Remove from heat, season with 
            salt if needed, and divide into bowls. Serve right 
            away, topping with more grated cheese and freshly 
            ground pepper as desired.</li>
        </ol>
