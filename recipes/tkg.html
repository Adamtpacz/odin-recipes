            <p>Tamago gohan (literally "egg rice") — rice mixed with a raw egg — 
        is Japanese comfort food at its simplest. It's one of my favorite 
            recipes of all time, and something that can be made in minutes.</p>

            <h3 class="heading">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup hot cooked white rice (about 12 ounces cooked rice)</li>
                <li>1 large egg (plus 1 optional egg yolk)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon soy sauce, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon mirin (optional)</li>
                <li>Pinch kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>Pinch MSG powder (optional)</li>
                <li>Pinch Hondashi (optional)</li>
                <li>Furikake to taste (optional)</li>
                <li>Thinly sliced or torn nori to taste (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3 class="heading">Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place rice in a bowl and make a shallow indentation in the 
                center. Break the whole egg into the center. Season with 1/2 
                teaspoon soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon mirin (if using), a pinch of salt, 
                a pinch of MSG (if using), and a pinch of Hondashi (if using).</li>
                <li>Stir vigorously with chopsticks to incorporate egg; it should 
                become pale yellow, frothy, and fluffy in texture. Taste and adjust 
                seasonings as necessary.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with furikake and nori (if using), make a small 
                indentation in the top, and add the other egg yolk (if using). 
                Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
