        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tamago gohan (literally "egg rice") — rice mixed with a raw egg — 
        is Japanese comfort food at its simplest. It's one of my favorite 
        recipes of all time, and something that can be made in minutes.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup hot cooked white rice (about 12 ounces cooked rice)</li>
            <li>1 large egg (plus 1 optional egg yolk)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon soy sauce, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon mirin (optional)</li>
            <li>Pinch kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>Pinch MSG powder (optional)</li>
            <li>Pinch Hondashi (optional)</li>
            <li>Furikake to taste (optional)</li>
            <li>Thinly sliced or torn nori to taste (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place rice in a bowl and make a shallow indentation in the 
            center. Break the whole egg into the center. Season with 1/2 
            teaspoon soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon mirin (if using), a pinch of salt, 
            a pinch of MSG (if using), and a pinch of Hondashi (if using).</li>
            <li>Stir vigorously with chopsticks to incorporate egg; it should 
            become pale yellow, frothy, and fluffy in texture. Taste and adjust 
            seasonings as necessary.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with furikake and nori (if using), make a small 
            indentation in the top, and add the other egg yolk (if using). 
            Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
